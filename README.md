# Flappy_bird_game

#Description  
This is a simple implementation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Pygame.   
The player controls a bird, attempting to fly between rows of green pipes without hitting them.   
Each successful pass through a pair of pipes earns the player one point.   
The game ends if the bird collides with a pipe or touches the ground or ceiling.  

#Features  
Simple and intuitive controls (press Space to flap).  
Score tracking and display.  
Sound effects for flapping, collisions, and score updates.  
Restart option after game over.  
Randomized pipe generation for endless gameplay.  

#Installation  
Python: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.  
Pygame: Install Pygame using pip:  
pip install pygame  
Download Assets: Download the game assets (images and sounds) from [https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/10178-flappy-bird-sounds#google_vignette] and my image folder in repository and place them in the images/ and sounds/ directories respectively.  
  
#How to Play  
Run the game by executing flappy_bird.py.  
Press Space to make the bird flap and navigate through the pipes.  
Avoid colliding with the pipes or going out of bounds.  
Earn points for passing through pipes.  
The game ends when the bird collides, and you can restart by pressing 'R'.
